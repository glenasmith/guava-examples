guava-examples
==============

If you're going through the process of learning [Google Guava](http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/), it can be helpful to have a few sample Unit Tests that you can play with to demonstrat the key features of the library (and give you a chance to tinker on your own).

In this small repo, I'm planning on capturing the basics of the common classes used in Guava. Feel free to dive in and run some of the tests to get a feel for it. 

It will save you a ton of time!

Enjoy!
